## Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Read the problem carefully
- A farmer has 17 sheep
- "All but 9 run away"

**Step 2:** Interpret "all but 9"
- "All but 9" means "all except 9"
- So 9 sheep did NOT run away
- The remaining sheep (17 - 9) = 8 sheep did run away

**Step 3:** Answer the question
- The question asks "How many sheep does the farmer have left?"
- Since 9 sheep did NOT run away, the farmer has 9 sheep left

**Answer: 9 sheep**

## Why this problem tricks most people:

The problem tricks people because of the misleading phrasing "All but 9 run away." When people hear "all but 9," they often think:
- "All of them except 9 ran away" 
- This makes them focus on the number that ran away (8) rather than the number that stayed
- The phrase "all but 9" is counterintuitive - it's easier to think "9 ran away" instead of "9 stayed"

The key is understanding that "all but 9" means "everything except 9," so 9 sheep remain, not 8. This is a classic example of how word choice can create confusion even when the math is simple.
