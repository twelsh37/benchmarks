This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle that requires you to think outside the box and consider alternatives to the expected solution. The problem states that all but 9 sheep run away, which means that only 9 sheep are left. However, this solution does not make sense because it would leave the farmer with negative sheep (i.e., -9).

The correct solution is that the farmer has 8 sheep left. This may seem like a strange answer, but it is the only logical explanation based on the information provided in the problem. The key to solving this puzzle is to recognize that the phrase "all but 9" is misleading and does not actually mean what it says. Instead of indicating that all sheep except for 9 have run away, it means that all sheep except for 8 have run away.

This problem tricks most people because it relies on a common assumption about language and logic. We often assume that "all but X" means that everything except for X has happened. However, in this case, the phrase "all but 9" actually means something different, which requires us to think creatively and consider alternative interpretations of the problem.
