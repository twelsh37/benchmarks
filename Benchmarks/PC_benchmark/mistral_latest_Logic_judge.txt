Scores: Correctness=9, Efficiency=10, Outcome=10
Reasoning: The response correctly identifies the strategy of picking from the 'Mixed' box and deduces labels accurately. The explanation is clear, though it slightly misses emphasizing that the first picked fruit determines whether the identified box contains apples or oranges initially.
