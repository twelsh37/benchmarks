Scores: Correctness=10, Efficiency=10, Outcome=10
Reasoning: The code correctly identifies elements appearing more than once, uses an O(n) approach with a dictionary for counting, and includes all required elements: function name, type hints, docstring, example, and working code.

Raw Judge Response:
```json
{
  "correctness": 10,
  "efficiency": 10,
  "outcome": 10,
  "reasoning": "The code correctly identifies elements appearing more than once, uses an O(n) approach with a dictionary for counting, and includes all required elements: function name, type hints, docstring, example, and working code."
}
```

### Justification:

1. **Correctness (10/10)**:
   - The logic to find duplicates is correct. It counts occurrences of each element using a dictionary, then filters out those that appear more than once.
   - The function correctly returns `[2, 4, 9]` for the given example input.

2. **Efficiency (10/10)**:
   - The solution uses a dictionary to count occurrences in O(n) time complexity.
   - This is an efficient and Pythonic approach using built-in data structures.

3. **Outcome (10/10)**:
   - All requirements are met: the function has the correct name, type hints, a docstring, and a working example call.
   - The code is clean, readable, and functional. 

Overall, the response meets all criteria for correctness, efficiency, and completeness.
