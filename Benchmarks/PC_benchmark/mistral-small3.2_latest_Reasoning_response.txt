Let's solve the problem step by step:

**Problem Statement:**
A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 run away. How many sheep does the farmer have left?

**Solution:**
1. The farmer initially has 17 sheep.
2. The phrase "all but 9 run away" means that all of the sheep except for 9 run away.
3. Therefore, the number of sheep that run away is 17 - 9 = 8 sheep.
4. The number of sheep left with the farmer is the 9 that did not run away.

**Answer:**
The farmer has 9 sheep left.

**Explanation of the Trick:**
This problem tricks most people because of the phrasing "all but 9 run away." Many readers might misinterpret this to mean that 9 sheep run away, leading them to subtract 9 from 17 and conclude that 8 sheep are left. However, the correct interpretation is that all sheep except for 9 run away, meaning 9 sheep remain. The trick lies in the ambiguity of the phrase "all but," which can be confusing if not read carefully.
