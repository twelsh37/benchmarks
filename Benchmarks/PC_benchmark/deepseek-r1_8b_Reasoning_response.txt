The farmer has 17 sheep, and "all but 9 run away" means that all except 9 sheep ran away. Therefore, 9 sheep did not run away and are left with the farmer.

The problem tricks most people because of the ambiguous phrasing of "all but 9." Many people misinterpret this to mean that 9 sheep ran away, leading them to subtract 9 from 17 and incorrectly conclude that 8 sheep are left. However, "all but 9" means "all except 9," so 9 sheep are the ones that did not run away.
