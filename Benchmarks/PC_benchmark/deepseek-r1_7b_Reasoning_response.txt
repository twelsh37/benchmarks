**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Sheep Initially:**
   
   The farmer starts with **17 sheep**.

2. **Sheep That Ran Away:**
   
   It says "All but 9" ran away. 
   
   - **"All but"** means all except.
   
   So, if **9 sheep remain**, the number of sheep that ran away is:
   
   \[
   \text{Total Sheep} - \text{Sheep Remaining} = 17 - 9 = 8
   \]
   
3. **Sheep Left With the Farmer:**
   
   After all but 9 have run away, **9 sheep** are left.

4. **Final Answer:**

   The farmer has **\boxed{9} sheep left**.

**Why This Problem Tricks People:**

The phrase "All but" can be confusing because it implies that most of the sheep have left, leaving only a few behind. Many people might mistakenly think that since "all but 9 ran away," there are no sheep left, leading to an incorrect answer of **0** instead of the correct answer of **9**.

\[
\boxed{9}
