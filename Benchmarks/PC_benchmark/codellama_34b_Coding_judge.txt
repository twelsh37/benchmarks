Scores: Correctness=10, Efficiency=9, Outcome=10
Reasoning: The solution correctly identifies elements appearing more than once using a set to track seen elements, ensuring O(n) complexity. It includes all required components: function name, type hints, docstring, and example call.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

- **Correctness (10/10):**
  - The logic is accurate for finding elements that appear more than once in the list.
  - It correctly appends an element to `duplicate_elements` only after it has been seen at least twice.

- **Efficiency (9/10):**
  - The use of a set allows for O(1) average time complexity checks, and iterating over the list is O(n), resulting in overall O(n) efficiency.
  - Slight deduction because `set.add()` and `list.append()` could be seen as minor overheads compared to using Python's `collections.Counter` which might offer cleaner code with similar efficiency.

- **Outcome (10/10):**
  - The function name, type hints, and docstring are correctly implemented.
  - An example call is provided demonstrating the function's usage and expected output.
  - All five requirements of the task are met.
