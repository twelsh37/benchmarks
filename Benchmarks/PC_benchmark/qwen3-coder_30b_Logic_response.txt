To solve this problem, I need to determine the minimum information needed to correctly label all three boxes.

Let me think through this step by step.

**Initial Setup:**
- Three boxes labeled: 'Apples', 'Oranges', and 'Mixed'
- All labels are wrong (each box contains the wrong label)
- I can pick one fruit from one box

**Key Insight:**
Since all labels are wrong, I know:
- The 'Apples' box doesn't contain only apples
- The 'Oranges' box doesn't contain only oranges  
- The 'Mixed' box doesn't contain mixed fruits

**Strategy:**
I should pick from the 'Mixed' box because it's the most informative choice.

**Why the 'Mixed' box?**
If I pick from the 'Mixed' box:
- If I get an apple, then this box actually contains only apples (since it can't contain mixed fruits)
- If I get an orange, then this box actually contains only oranges

**The reasoning:**
1. Pick one fruit from the 'Mixed' box
2. Let's say I get an apple
3. This means the 'Mixed' box actually contains only apples
4. Since the 'Apples' box cannot contain apples (all labels are wrong), it must contain either only oranges or mixed fruits
5. Since the 'Mixed' box contains apples, the 'Oranges' box must contain the mixed fruits
6. Therefore, the 'Apples' box must contain only oranges

**Minimum information needed:**
**Just one fruit pick from the 'Mixed' box.**

This single piece of information is sufficient because:
- It tells us what the 'Mixed' box actually contains
- Since all labels are wrong, we know the other two boxes contain the remaining types of fruits
- We can then deduce the correct labels for all three boxes

The answer is **one fruit pick from the 'Mixed' box** - this single piece of information is enough to correctly label all boxes.
