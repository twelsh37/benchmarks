Scores: Correctness=10, Efficiency=9, Outcome=10
Reasoning: The response correctly states the answer is 9 and provides a clear explanation of why 'all but 9' means 9 remain, addressing both parts effectively. It's slightly less than perfect in efficiency due to minor redundancy but remains concise.
