Scores: Correctness=9, Efficiency=8, Outcome=9
Reasoning: The response correctly identifies the answer as 9 sheep and explains why 'all but 9' means 9 remain. However, it includes an unnecessary calculation step (17 - 9 = 8) which could cause minor confusion despite ultimately reaching the correct conclusion.
