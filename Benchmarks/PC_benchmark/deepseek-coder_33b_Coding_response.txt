Here is how you could do it using Python:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def find_duplicates(input_list: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """Find and return all elements in a list that appear more than once.
    
    Parameters:
    input_list (List[Any]): The list to search for duplicates.
    
    Returns:
    List[Any]: A new list containing only the duplicate elements.
    """
    # Create an empty dictionary to store element counts
    count_dict = {}

    # Iterate over each element in input_list and update count_dict
    for elem in input_list:
        if elem not in count_dict:
            count_dict[elem] = 1
        else:
            count_dict[elem] += 1
    
    # Create a new list to store duplicate elements
    duplicates = [k for k, v in count_dict.items() if v > 1]

    return duplicates
```

Here is an example of calling it:

```python
>>> find_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10])
[2, 4, 9]
```
