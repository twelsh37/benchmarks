"mistral:latest","Reasoning",9,8,9,8.7,158.97,182,4.44,"OK","The response correctly identifies the answer as 9 and adequately explains why 'all but 9' means 9 remain. The explanation is clear, though it includes an unnecessary calculation step. Both parts of the question are addressed effectively."
"mistral:latest","Coding",9,4,10,7.7,152.04,302,2.2,"OK","The code correctly identifies elements that appear more than once, but the efficiency is compromised by using data.count() in a loop, leading to O(n^2) complexity. All required components are present."
"mistral:latest","Logic",9,10,10,9.7,140.55,245,1.83,"OK","The response correctly identifies the strategy of picking from the 'Mixed' box and deduces labels accurately. The explanation is clear, though it slightly misses emphasizing that the first picked fruit determines whether the identified box contains apples or oranges initially."
"deepseek-coder:33b","Reasoning",3,4,3,3.3,42.08,261,18.01,"OK","The model provided the incorrect answer of 8 sheep instead of 9, demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding. It did not correctly interpret 'all but 9' as meaning 9 remain."

"deepseek-coder:33b","Logic",3,2,1,2.0,40.18,425,16.5,"OK","The response fails to provide the correct approach by incorrectly referencing the Monty Hall problem and misinterpreting the logic required. The deduction chain is incorrect, leading to an invalid conclusion about information bits needed."
"deepseek-r1:7b","Reasoning",10,9,10,9.7,156.33,382,6.65,"OK","The response accurately states the correct answer and effectively explains why the problem is tricky. It correctly interprets 'all but' as excluding, not leaving zero sheep behind."

"deepseek-r1:32b","Coding",9,10,8,9.0,37.58,6209,174.54,"OK","The logic for finding duplicates is mostly correct, using a two-pass approach with O(n) complexity. However, it slightly misses the mark on type hints and docstring requirements."
"deepseek-r1:32b","Logic",10,10,10,10.0,38.33,3831,108.25,"OK","The response correctly identifies the box to pick from, provides a complete and correct deduction chain for both possible outcomes, clearly explains each step, and states the minimum information required to solve the problem."
"deepseek-r1:8b","Reasoning",10,9,10,9.7,134.93,1590,16.97,"OK","The response correctly states the answer is 9 and provides a clear explanation of why 'all but 9' means 9 remain, addressing both parts effectively. It's slightly less than perfect in efficiency due to minor redundancy but remains concise."
"deepseek-r1:8b","Coding",10,9,10,9.7,124.29,4571,37.86,"OK","The code correctly identifies and returns duplicates, uses a dictionary to count frequencies (O(n)), and maintains order with an additional list traversal. It includes all necessary components: function name, type hints, docstring, example call, and working code."
