Alright, let's tackle this puzzle step by step. We have three boxes, each labeled incorrectly:

1. Box labeled 'Apples'
2. Box labeled 'Oranges'
3. Box labeled 'Mixed'

Our goal is to correctly label all the boxes by picking just one fruit from one box. Here's how I think we can approach this:

### Understanding the Problem

First, it's crucial to understand that all the labels are wrong. This means:

- The box labeled 'Apples' does not contain only apples; it could have oranges or a mix.
- The box labeled 'Oranges' does not contain only oranges; it could have apples or a mix.
- The box labeled 'Mixed' does not contain a mix; it must contain only apples or only oranges.

### Strategy

Since all labels are incorrect, we can use this information to our advantage. Here's the plan:

1. **Pick a fruit from the box labeled 'Mixed'.**
   - Since the label is wrong, this box cannot contain a mix. It must contain only one type of fruit: either all apples or all oranges.

2. **Determine the contents of the 'Mixed' box based on the fruit picked.**
   - Suppose we pick an apple from the box labeled 'Mixed'. This means the box labeled 'Mixed' actually contains only apples.

3. **Deduce the contents of the other boxes.**
   - Now, we know the box labeled 'Mixed' has apples. So, the box labeled 'Apples' cannot have apples (since all labels are wrong). It also cannot have a mix (because the 'Mixed' box is already correctly identified as apples). Therefore, the box labeled 'Apples' must contain oranges.
   - That leaves the box labeled 'Oranges'. It cannot have oranges (label is wrong), and it cannot have apples (since the 'Mixed' box has apples). Therefore, it must contain the mix.

### Verifying the Approach

Let's verify this with an example:

- **Step 1:** Pick a fruit from the box labeled 'Mixed'.
  - Suppose we pick an apple. So, the box labeled 'Mixed' is actually 'Apples'.

- **Step 2:** Now, consider the box labeled 'Apples'.
  - It cannot be 'Apples' (label is wrong).
  - It cannot be 'Mixed' because the 'Mixed' box is already correctly identified as 'Apples'.
  - Therefore, it must be 'Oranges'.

- **Step 3:** The remaining box is labeled 'Oranges'.
  - It cannot be 'Oranges' (label is wrong).
  - It cannot be 'Apples' because the 'Mixed' box is 'Apples'.
  - Therefore, it must be 'Mixed'.

This logic holds if we pick an apple from the 'Mixed' box. Similarly, if we pick an orange from the 'Mixed' box:

- **Step 1:** Pick an orange from the box labeled 'Mixed'.
  - So, the box labeled 'Mixed' is actually 'Oranges'.

- **Step 2:** Consider the box labeled 'Oranges'.
  - It cannot be 'Oranges' (label is wrong).
  - It cannot be 'Mixed' because the 'Mixed' box is already correctly identified as 'Oranges'.
  - Therefore, it must be 'Apples'.

- **Step 3:** The remaining box is labeled 'Apples'.
  - It cannot be 'Apples' (label is wrong).
  - It cannot be 'Oranges' because the 'Mixed' box is 'Oranges'.
  - Therefore, it must be 'Mixed'.

### Conclusion

By picking just one fruit from the box labeled 'Mixed', we can correctly relabel all the boxes. Here's the step-by-step summary:

1. **Pick a fruit from the box labeled 'Mixed'.**
   - If you pick an apple:
     - Box labeled 'Mixed' is 'Apples'.
     - Box labeled 'Apples' cannot be 'Apples' or 'Mixed', so it's 'Oranges'.
     - Box labeled 'Oranges' must be 'Mixed'.
   - If you pick an orange:
     - Box labeled 'Mixed' is 'Oranges'.
     - Box labeled 'Oranges' cannot be 'Oranges' or 'Mixed', so it's 'Apples'.
     - Box labeled 'Apples' must be 'Mixed'.

This method ensures that with just one fruit picked from the 'Mixed' box, we can correctly relabel all the boxes.
