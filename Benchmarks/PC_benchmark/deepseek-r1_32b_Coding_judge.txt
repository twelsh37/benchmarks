Scores: Correctness=9, Efficiency=10, Outcome=8
Reasoning: The logic for finding duplicates is mostly correct, using a two-pass approach with O(n) complexity. However, it slightly misses the mark on type hints and docstring requirements.

### Explanation

**Correctness (9/10):**
- The function correctly identifies elements appearing more than once and returns them in the order of their first occurrence.
- It uses `defaultdict` for counting occurrences efficiently.
- A minor issue is that it doesn't handle edge cases explicitly, such as an empty list or lists with no duplicates, but these do not affect correctness.

**Efficiency (10/10):**
- The solution achieves O(n) complexity by using a dictionary to count occurrences and a set to track added elements in the result.
- This is efficient and leverages Python's data structures effectively for linear time performance.

**Outcome (8/10):**
- **Function Name:** Met.
- **Type Hints:** Not provided; this is a missing requirement.
- **Docstring:** Missing, which is another requirement not met.
- **Example Call:** Not shown in the response, but the function logic and implementation are correct.
- **Working Code:** The code works as intended for identifying duplicates.

The solution meets most requirements effectively but lacks type hints and a docstring, slightly reducing the completeness score.
