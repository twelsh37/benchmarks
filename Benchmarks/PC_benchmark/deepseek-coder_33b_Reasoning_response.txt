Let's solve this step-by-step in Python:

```python
# Step 1: Define the initial number of sheep the farmer has.
total_sheep = 17

# Step 2: Define the number of sheep that ran away.
ran_away = 9

# Step 3: Subtract the number of sheep that ran away from the total.
remaining_sheep = total_sheep - ran_away

# Step 4: Print out the result.
print("The farmer has", remaining_sheep, "sheep left.")
```

When you run this program, it will output: `The farmer has 8 sheep left.`

This problem is tricky because it's given a specific total number of items (in this case, the original amount of sheep) and then another number that represents some of those items having been lost or gone in some way (the number of sheep that ran away). It seems like there should be 8 left, but we have to subtract the "lost" sheep from the total. This is a common type of problem where the statement given does not match what you expect when reading it as a straightforward count or calculation.
