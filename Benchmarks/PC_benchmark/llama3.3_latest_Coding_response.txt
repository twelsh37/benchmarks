### Find Duplicates Function
```python
from typing import List, Any

def find_duplicates(input_list: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """
    This function takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the elements that appear more than once.

    Args:
        input_list (List[Any]): The input list to check for duplicates.

    Returns:
        List[Any]: A list of duplicate elements.
    """
    seen = set()
    duplicates = set()

    # Iterate over the input list
    for item in input_list:
        if item in seen:
            duplicates.add(item)
        else:
            seen.add(item)

    return list(duplicates)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 5]
    print(find_duplicates(my_list))  # Output: [2, 5]
```

In this code:

- We define a function `find_duplicates` that takes a list of any type as input and returns a list of the same type.
- Inside the function, we use two sets (`seen` and `duplicates`) to keep track of elements we've seen so far and the duplicates, respectively.
- We iterate over each item in the input list. If an item is already in the `seen` set, it's a duplicate, so we add it to the `duplicates` set.
- Finally, we convert the `duplicates` set back into a list and return it.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list, because looking up an item in a set takes constant time on average.
