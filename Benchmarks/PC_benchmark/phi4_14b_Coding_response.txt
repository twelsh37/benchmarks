Here's a Python function `find_duplicates` with type hints and a docstring. This function takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the elements that appear more than once in the original list.

```python
from typing import List

def find_duplicates(input_list: List) -> List:
    """
    Returns a list of duplicate elements from the given list.
    
    Parameters:
    - input_list (List): A list of elements where duplicates may exist.
    
    Returns:
    - List: A new list containing only the elements that appear more than once in the original list.
    
    Example:
    >>> find_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 5])
    [2, 5]
    """
    # Dictionary to count occurrences of each element
    counts = {}
    for item in input_list:
        if item in counts:
            counts[item] += 1
        else:
            counts[item] = 1
    
    # Collect elements that appear more than once
    duplicates = [item for item, count in counts.items() if count > 1]
    
    return duplicates

# Example of calling the function
example_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 5]
duplicates = find_duplicates(example_list)
print(duplicates)  # Output: [2, 5]
```

In this implementation:
- A dictionary `counts` is used to track the number of occurrences for each element.
- The function iterates over the input list and updates the count in the dictionary.
- Finally, a list comprehension is used to create a list of elements that have more than one occurrence.
