Scores: Correctness=10, Efficiency=10, Outcome=10
Reasoning: The code correctly implements the logic to find duplicates using an O(n) approach with sets, includes type hints and a comprehensive docstring, and provides multiple working example calls demonstrating its functionality.

}

**Explanation:**

- **Correctness (10/10):** The function `find_duplicates` accurately identifies elements appearing more than once in the list. It uses sets to track seen items and duplicates efficiently, returning them in order of their first occurrence.

- **Efficiency (10/10):** The solution utilizes a two-pass O(n) approach with sets for optimal performance. This is efficient as it avoids nested loops and leverages set operations to maintain an overall linear time complexity.

- **Outcome (10/10):** The response fulfills all the requirements: defining `find_duplicates` with type hints, including a detailed docstring, demonstrating usage through example calls, and producing working code that meets the specified criteria.
