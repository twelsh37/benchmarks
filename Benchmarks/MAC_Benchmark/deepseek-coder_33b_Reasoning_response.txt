The problem is misleading because it's not clear from the statement how many sheep actually ran away, just that nine don't count. If all 17 go, but only 9 count, then no sheep remain at the end of the process. 

Let's break this down:

The farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 run away. 

We start with the first clause: "A farmer has 17 sheep." This is a given or fact. There are exactly 17 sheep for us to work with.

Next, we know from the second clause that all sheep except nine ran away. We don't know which ones or how many. But since it says "All but 9 run away," we assume that none of the original group of 17 sheep are included in these 9 left, because if they were, they would be counted as "all".

Finally, we need to calculate how many sheep are left. We don't know this from the problem statement and it seems impossible without more information. 

The problem is a bit ambiguous because we don't know exactly which sheep ran away or how many of them. Without more context, there isn't enough information for us to solve the problem step-by-step. If some sheep were already counted as "all", then it would make no sense for all but 9 to run away because that would leave none left. So, this question seems flawed in its wording and lacks sufficient detail or context.
