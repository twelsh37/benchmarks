 Here is a Python function called `find_duplicates` with type hints, a docstring, and an example of its usage:

```python
from typing import List

def find_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    This function returns a new list containing only the elements that appear more than once in the input list.

    Parameters:
        numbers (List[int]): A sorted and non-empty list of integers.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A new list containing the duplicate elements from the input list.
    """

    duplicates = []
    current_number = None

    for number in numbers:
        if current_number is None or number != current_number:
            current_number = number
        else:
            duplicates.append(current_number)

    return duplicates

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
duplicates = find_duplicates(numbers)
print(duplicates)  # Output: [2, 4]
```

In this example, the `find_duplicates` function takes a sorted and non-empty list of integers, finds the duplicate numbers, and returns them in a new list. The function uses a simple O(n) approach to solve the problem by keeping track of the current number in the list and checking for duplicates as it iterates through the input list.
