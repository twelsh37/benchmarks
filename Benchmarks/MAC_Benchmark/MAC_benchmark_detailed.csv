"mistral:latest","Reasoning",10,9,10,9.7,84.74,131,1.83,"OK","The response correctly identifies that the answer is 9 sheep and provides a clear explanation of why 'all but 9' means 9 remain. It loses one point in efficiency for slightly verbose phrasing but otherwise is concise."
"mistral:latest","Coding",8,9,9,8.7,82.63,349,4.79,"OK","The code mostly works but assumes the input list is sorted, which is not mentioned in the prompt. The solution uses an efficient O(n) approach and meets most requirements except for handling unsorted lists."
"mistral:latest","Logic",10,10,10,10.0,82.86,248,3.5,"OK","The response correctly identifies picking from the 'Mixed' box and logically deduces the labels of all boxes with no errors. The explanation is clear, concise, and follows a logical progression without unnecessary steps."
"deepseek-coder:33b","Reasoning",3,4,2,3.0,21.82,327,29.63,"OK","The response incorrectly concludes that no sheep remain, misunderstanding 'all but 9' to mean none are left. It also fails to correctly explain why the problem is tricky."
"deepseek-coder:33b","Coding",10,10,10,10.0,21.6,359,17.83,"OK","The solution correctly implements the logic for finding elements that appear more than once using a dictionary to count occurrences, resulting in an O(n) time complexity. All key requirements including function name, type hints, docstring, and working example are met."
"deepseek-coder:33b","Logic",3,2,1,2.0,21.5,353,17.5,"OK","The model uses an incorrect approach by suggesting the need for multiple examples rather than solving the problem with a single fruit from the 'Mixed' box. The solution should rely on logical deduction, not Bayesian inference or multiple combinations."
"deepseek-r1:7b","Reasoning",10,9,10,9.7,82.1,471,12.36,"OK","The response correctly identifies the number of sheep remaining and explains why the phrasing is tricky. It's mostly concise but includes a minor unnecessary step in breaking down the calculation."
"deepseek-r1:7b","Coding",10,10,10,10.0,76.0,2233,41.55,"OK","The response correctly implements the function 'find_duplicates' with accurate logic, efficient use of a dictionary for counting, and includes type hints, docstring, and a working example."
"deepseek-r1:7b","Logic",10,10,10,10.0,63.44,10032,211.72,"OK","The response correctly identifies the 'Mixed' box to pick from, uses a single fruit to deduce all labels accurately, and provides a clear logical deduction chain without extraneous details."
"deepseek-r1:32b","Reasoning",10,9,10,9.7,18.6,340,33.41,"OK","The response correctly identifies the answer as 9 and explains why 'all but 9' means 9 remain, effectively addressing both parts of the task. The explanation is clear, though slightly verbose in calculation steps."
"deepseek-r1:32b","Coding",10,10,10,10.0,18.64,1295,77.27,"OK","The solution correctly identifies elements appearing more than once, uses a dictionary for O(n) complexity, and meets all requirements with type hints, docstring, and example."
"deepseek-r1:32b","Logic",10,10,10,10.0,16.32,2984,198.9,"OK","The response correctly identifies the box to pick from and provides a complete, logical deduction chain for both possible outcomes. It clearly explains the reasoning without any unnecessary information."
"deepseek-r1:8b","Reasoning",10,9,10,9.7,61.59,1139,21.67,"OK","The response correctly identifies the answer as 9 and provides an accurate explanation of why 'all but 9' means 9 remain. The reasoning is clear, though slightly verbose in the step-by-step breakdown."
"deepseek-r1:8b","Coding",10,10,10,10.0,62.1,3129,51.14,"OK","The function correctly implements the logic to find elements appearing more than once, uses a dictionary for O(n) efficiency, and meets all requirements including type hints, docstring, and an example call."

"qwen3-coder:30b","Reasoning",10,9,10,9.7,72.73,375,10.46,"OK","The response correctly identifies the answer as 9 sheep and explains why 'all but 9' means 9 remain. The explanation is clear, though slightly verbose in parts."
"qwen3-coder:30b","Coding",10,10,10,10.0,71.63,513,7.71,"OK","The code correctly identifies elements that appear more than once, using an efficient O(n) approach with sets. It includes type hints, a detailed docstring, and example calls, meeting all requirements."
"qwen3-coder:30b","Logic",10,10,10,10.0,71.43,414,6.37,"OK","The response correctly identifies the minimum information needed by picking from the 'Mixed' box and logically deduces the correct labels for all boxes. The explanation is clear, concise, and follows a logical progression without unnecessary steps."
"mistral-small3.2:latest","Reasoning",10,9,10,9.7,28.73,205,14.78,"OK","The response accurately states the correct answer and provides a clear explanation of why 'all but 9' means that 9 sheep remain. The only minor deduction in efficiency is due to slightly more detailed steps than necessary, but it remains concise overall."
"mistral-small3.2:latest","Coding",10,10,10,10.0,27.82,448,17.05,"OK","The solution correctly identifies elements appearing more than once using sets, ensuring O(n) time complexity. It includes type hints, a comprehensive docstring, and an example call with the expected output."
"mistral-small3.2:latest","Logic",10,10,10,10.0,24.61,1385,57.5,"OK","The response accurately identifies picking a fruit from the 'Mixed' box as the solution, providing a clear and complete deduction chain with no incorrect steps or omissions."
"phi4:14b","Reasoning",10,9,10,9.7,42.91,232,6.63,"OK","The response correctly identifies the answer as 9 and explains why 'all but 9' means that 9 remain. The reasoning is clear, though slightly verbose in explanation."
"phi4:14b","Coding",10,10,10,10.0,30.4,462,17.18,"OK","The code correctly identifies and returns elements appearing more than once, efficiently using a dictionary for O(n) complexity. It meets all requirements with type hints, docstring, and example."
"phi4:14b","Logic",10,10,10,10.0,29.11,463,17.92,"OK","The response correctly identifies the need to pick one fruit from the 'Mixed' labeled box and follows through with a complete deduction chain, providing clear and accurate reasoning for each step."
"codellama:34b","Reasoning",1,3,2,2.0,17.64,66,11.58,"OK","The answer is incorrect, stating there are 8 sheep left instead of the correct 9. The reasoning does not correctly explain why 'all but 9' means 9 remain, only mentioning it as a brain teaser."
"codellama:34b","Coding",6,4,9,6.3,18.3,158,9.33,"OK","The function has logic errors because it returns duplicate entries like ['banana', 'orange'] multiple times. The approach is not efficient as it uses list.count() in a loop, making the solution O(n^2). However, it meets most of the requirements including type hints and docstring."
"codellama:34b","Logic",3,1,1,1.7,18.68,545,30.32,"OK","The response starts with incorrect assumptions about the labels and fails to provide a correct deduction chain. It does not address picking one fruit from the 'Mixed' box, which is crucial for solving the puzzle."
