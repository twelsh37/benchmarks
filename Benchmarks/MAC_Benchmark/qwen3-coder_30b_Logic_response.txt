To solve this problem, I need to determine the minimum information needed to correctly label all three boxes.

Let me think through this step by step.

**Initial Setup:**
- Three boxes labeled: 'Apples', 'Oranges', and 'Mixed'
- All labels are wrong (each box is mislabeled)
- I can pick one fruit from one box

**Key Insight:**
Since all labels are wrong, I know:
- The 'Apples' box doesn't contain only apples
- The 'Oranges' box doesn't contain only oranges  
- The 'Mixed' box doesn't contain mixed fruits

**Strategy:**
I should pick from the 'Mixed' box because it's the most informative choice.

**Why the 'Mixed' box?**
- Since the label is wrong, it must contain either only apples OR only oranges
- If I pick an apple from the 'Mixed' box, then:
  - This box actually contains only apples
  - The 'Apples' box must contain mixed fruits (since it can't contain only apples)
  - The 'Oranges' box must contain only oranges
- If I pick an orange from the 'Mixed' box, then:
  - This box actually contains only oranges
  - The 'Oranges' box must contain mixed fruits (since it can't contain only oranges)
  - The 'Apples' box must contain only apples

**Minimum Information Needed:**
**Just one fruit pick from the 'Mixed' box.**

This single piece of information is sufficient because:
1. It tells me what type of fruit is actually in the 'Mixed' box
2. Since all labels are wrong, I can deduce the contents of the other two boxes
3. The logic is deterministic - there's only one correct arrangement

**Answer:** The minimum information needed is **one fruit picked from the 'Mixed' box**. This single observation, combined with the constraint that all labels are wrong, completely determines the correct labeling of all three boxes.
