Scores: Correctness=8, Efficiency=9, Outcome=9
Reasoning: The code mostly works but assumes the input list is sorted, which is not mentioned in the prompt. The solution uses an efficient O(n) approach and meets most requirements except for handling unsorted lists.

Raw Judge Response:
```json
{
  "correctness": 8,
  "efficiency": 9,
  "outcome": 9,
  "reasoning": "The code mostly works but assumes the input list is sorted, which is not mentioned in the prompt. The solution uses an efficient O(n) approach and meets most requirements except for handling unsorted lists."
}
``` 

### Breakdown:

**Correctness (8/10):**
- **Logic:** The function effectively identifies duplicates by iterating through a sorted list and comparing consecutive elements.
- **Assumption Issue:** It assumes the input list is sorted, which might lead to incorrect results if not met. This assumption wasn't specified in the prompt, reducing correctness slightly.

**Efficiency (9/10):**
- **Approach:** The function uses an O(n) approach by iterating through the list once.
- **Optimality:** While it's efficient for sorted lists, handling unsorted lists would require a different approach or sorting first, which could impact efficiency.

**Outcome (9/10):**
- **Requirements Met:** The function name, type hints, docstring, and example usage are all provided. It mostly meets the requirements but fails to handle unsorted lists.
- **Missing Aspect:** The solution doesn't explicitly address lists that aren't sorted, which is a significant oversight given the prompt's lack of such an assumption.

Overall, the response provides a solid solution with efficient logic for sorted lists and covers most requirements effectively.
