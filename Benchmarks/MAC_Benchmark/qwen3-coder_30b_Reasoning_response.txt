## Step-by-step Solution

**Step 1:** Read the problem carefully
- A farmer has 17 sheep
- "All but 9 run away"

**Step 2:** Interpret "All but 9"
- "All but 9" means "all except 9"
- So 9 sheep did NOT run away
- The remaining sheep (17 - 9) did run away

**Step 3:** Calculate
- 17 - 9 = 8 sheep ran away
- 9 sheep stayed (did not run away)

**Step 4:** Answer
The farmer has 9 sheep left.

## Why This Problem Tricks Most People

This problem uses a **misleading phrasing** that confuses the reader's interpretation:

1. **"All but 9 run away"** - The word "but" creates confusion because it's not immediately clear whether we're talking about 9 sheep running away or 9 sheep staying

2. **The brain automatically assumes** that if "all but 9" run away, then 9 sheep are the ones who ran away, when actually 9 sheep are the ones who stayed

3. **The word "but"** in this context means "except" - so "all but 9" means "all except 9"

4. **Most people misread it as**: "All 17 sheep run away, except 9" (meaning 9 ran away, 8 stayed)
- **Correct interpretation**: "All 17 sheep run away, except 9" (meaning 9 stayed, 8 ran away)

The problem is essentially a classic trick question that plays on how we naturally parse English sentences and our tendency to focus on the "run away" part rather than the "but 9" part.
