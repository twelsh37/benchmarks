Below is a Python function `find_duplicates` which takes a list as input and returns a new list containing elements that appear more than once. I've included type hints and a detailed docstring to explain the function's behavior.

```python
from typing import List, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')

def find_duplicates(input_list: List[T]) -> List[T]:
    """
    Identifies duplicate elements in a list and returns them as a new list.
    
    This function scans through the input list and collects all elements 
    that appear more than once. The result is returned as a new list without
    duplicates, i.e., each element appears only once in the output.

    Args:
        input_list (List[T]): A list of elements which may include duplicates.

    Returns:
        List[T]: A list containing only the duplicate elements from the input list.
                 Each duplicate will appear only once in this result list.

    Example:
        >>> find_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3])
        [2, 3]
        
        >>> find_duplicates(['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana'])
        ['apple', 'banana']
    """
    
    # Dictionary to keep track of element counts
    count_dict = {}
    for item in input_list:
        if item in count_dict:
            count_dict[item] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[item] = 1
    
    # List comprehension to collect items with a count greater than 1
    duplicates = [item for item, count in count_dict.items() if count > 1]
    
    return duplicates

# Example of calling the function
example_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3]
print(find_duplicates(example_list))
```

This code defines a function `find_duplicates` that uses a dictionary to count occurrences of each element in the list. It then creates a list of elements that appear more than once and returns this list. The example call demonstrates how the function works with an integer list.
