To solve this problem, we need to write a Python function called `find_duplicates` that takes a list and returns a new list containing only the elements that appear more than once in the input list. 

### Approach
The approach involves using a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the input list. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Initialize an empty dictionary**: This will be used to keep track of how many times each element appears.
2. **Iterate through each element in the input list**: For each element, if it is already in the dictionary, increment its count by 1. If it is not present, add it to the dictionary with a value of 1.
3. **Collect elements that appear more than once**: After counting all elements, iterate through the dictionary and collect all keys (elements) whose values (counts) are greater than 1.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count each element's occurrences in linear time, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. The final step to collect results runs in another pass over the dictionary items, which is also efficient and proportional to the number of unique elements.

### Solution Code

```python
from typing import List

def find_duplicates(lst: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    counts = {}
    for item in lst:
        if item in counts:
            counts[item] += 1
        else:
            counts[item] = 1
    return [k for k, v in counts.items() if v > 1]

# Example usage:
# duplicates = find_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 2])
# print(duplicates)  # Output: [2]
```

### Explanation
- **Type Hints**: The function uses `List[Any]` to specify that it accepts a list of any type of elements. This provides flexibility but also requires the use of generics for proper typing.
- **Counting Occurrences**: By iterating through each element and updating its count in the dictionary, we ensure that all occurrences are tallied efficiently.
- **Collecting Duplicates**: Using a list comprehension, we filter out elements that appear more than once based on their counts stored in the dictionary.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, making it suitable for lists of varying sizes. The function returns a new list containing each duplicate element exactly once, ensuring clarity and correctness in the output.
