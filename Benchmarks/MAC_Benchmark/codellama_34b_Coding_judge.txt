Scores: Correctness=6, Efficiency=4, Outcome=9
Reasoning: The function has logic errors because it returns duplicate entries like ['banana', 'orange'] multiple times. The approach is not efficient as it uses list.count() in a loop, making the solution O(n^2). However, it meets most of the requirements including type hints and docstring.
