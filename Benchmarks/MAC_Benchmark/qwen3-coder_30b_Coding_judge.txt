Scores: Correctness=10, Efficiency=10, Outcome=10
Reasoning: The code correctly identifies elements that appear more than once, using an efficient O(n) approach with sets. It includes type hints, a detailed docstring, and example calls, meeting all requirements.

### Breakdown of Evaluation:

**Correctness:**
- The function `find_duplicates` successfully returns elements appearing more than once in the list, preserving their original order of first occurrence.
- Logic is sound; it correctly identifies duplicates using sets to track seen items and detected duplicates.
- Example calls demonstrate functionality with different data types and scenarios.

**Efficiency:**
- Utilizes an O(n) solution by employing set operations for tracking occurrences. This approach efficiently processes each list item once, making it optimal in terms of time complexity.
- Clean and Pythonic implementation using sets to manage seen items and duplicates, avoiding unnecessary computations or nested loops.

**Outcome (Completeness):**
- The function is named `find_duplicates` as required.
- Type hints are included: `def find_duplicates(lst: List[T]) -> List[T]:`.
- A comprehensive docstring explains the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and provides examples.
- Example usage demonstrates the function with different test cases, including numbers, strings, and a list without duplicates.

Overall, the response is exemplary, meeting all criteria for correctness, efficiency, and completeness.
