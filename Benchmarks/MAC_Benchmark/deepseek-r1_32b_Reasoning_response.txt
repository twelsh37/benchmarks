**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many sheep the farmer has left.

1. **Total Sheep Initially:**  
   The farmer starts with **17 sheep**.

2. **Sheep that Ran Away:**  
   The phrase "All but 9" means that **all except 9 sheep ran away**.  
   
3. **Calculating Remaining Sheep:**  
   If all but 9 ran away, then the number of sheep remaining on the farm is:  
   \[
   17 - (17 - 9) = 9
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**  
   The farmer has **\(\boxed{9}\)** sheep left.

**Why This Problem Tricks Most People:**

The phrase "all but 9" can be misleading because it sounds like only a small number of sheep remain. However, the way it's phrased actually means that **only 9 sheep stayed behind**, not that 9 ran away. This plays on the tendency to misinterpret such phrases, leading many people to incorrectly assume fewer than 9 sheep are left or more sheep ran away than intended.
