Here's a Python function called `find_duplicates` that takes a list and returns a new list containing only the elements that appear more than once. The function includes type hints and a docstring, followed by an example of how to call it:

```python
from typing import List, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')

def find_duplicates(input_list: List[T]) -> List[T]:
    """
    Returns a list of elements that appear more than once in the input list.

    Args:
        input_list: The list to search for duplicates.

    Returns:
        A list containing elements that appear more than once in the input list.
        The order of elements in the returned list is not guaranteed to match
        the order in the input list.
    """
    seen = set()
    duplicates = set()

    for item in input_list:
        if item in seen:
            duplicates.add(item)
        else:
            seen.add(item)

    return list(duplicates)

# Example of calling the function
example_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 7]
result = find_duplicates(example_list)
print(result)  # Output: [2, 3, 7]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Type Hints**: The function uses `TypeVar` to make it generic, meaning it can work with lists of any type (e.g., integers, strings, etc.).
2. **Docstring**: The docstring explains the purpose of the function, its arguments, and what it returns.
3. **Logic**: The function uses two sets, `seen` and `duplicates`, to track items that have been encountered and items that are duplicates, respectively.
4. **Example**: The example list `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 7]` contains duplicates `2`, `3`, and `7`, so the function returns `[2, 3, 7]`. The order of the returned list may vary since sets are unordered.
