### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Total Number of Sheep:**
   - The farmer initially has **17 sheep**.

2. **Interpret the Phrase "All but 9 Run Away":**
   - The phrase "all but" means everyone except a certain number will do something.
   - In this case, "all but 9 run away" means that **all sheep except for 9** leave.

3. **Calculate the Number of Sheep Remaining:**
   - If all sheep except 9 leave, we need to find out how many are left behind.
   - **Total sheep = 17**
   - **Sheep that ran away = Total sheep - 9**
     \[
     \text{Sheep that ran away} = 17 - 9 = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of sheep remaining is:
     \[
     \text{Sheep left} = 9
     \]

### Final Answer:
The farmer has **\boxed{9}** sheep left.

### Why This Problem Tricks Most People:

This problem tricks many people because it uses the word "but" in a tricky way. It's easy to misinterpret "all but 9 run away" as meaning that only 9 sheep remain, which is actually correct! However, some might mistakenly subtract differently or get confused by the wording.

**Key Insight:**
- The phrase "all but X" means everyone except for X does something.
- In this case, all sheep **except** 9 ran away, leaving **9 sheep** behind.
