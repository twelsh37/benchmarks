You could solve this problem using Bayesian inference, but there's also an intuitive way we can think about it. 

Without looking into the boxes (let's call them A, O, M for 'Apples', 'Oranges', and 'Mixed'), you have no information to differentiate between fruits or boxes that are mixed. This means each box could contain any kind of fruit or a mix of two kinds of fruit:

1) Box "A" might be full of apples only (AAA).
2) Box "O" might be full of oranges only (OOO).
3) Both boxes "A" and "O" might be full of mixed fruits (AOA, OAO, AOO, OOA etc.). 
4) And lastly, box "M" might contain any kind of fruit (AAO, OOA, AOA, OOA etc.).

So the minimum information needed to correctly label all boxes is one example of each kind of combination. This is because by seeing one example of each, you can determine that: 
- Box "A" contains apples only.
- Box "O" contains oranges only.
- And box "M" contains a mix of both fruits.

This reasoning applies for boxes with any number of different types of fruit and combinations thereof - one example per type is enough to correctly label the boxes. 

For three types (Apples, Oranges, Mixed), you need three examples: AAA, OOO, and AMM or AOMAOM etc., which represent a scenario where each box contains exactly one type of fruit.
