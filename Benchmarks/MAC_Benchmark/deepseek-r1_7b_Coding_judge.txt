### Explanation:

- **Correctness (10/10):** The function `find_duplicates` is implemented correctly. It accurately identifies elements that appear more than once in the list by using a dictionary to count occurrences. The logic for identifying duplicates is sound.

- **Efficiency (10/10):** The solution uses a dictionary, achieving an O(n) time complexity for counting element occurrences and another pass over the dictionary items to collect duplicates, maintaining overall efficiency.

- **Outcome (10/10):** All five requirements are met: the function has the correct name, includes type hints (`List[Any]`), contains a clear docstring explaining its purpose, provides a working example call, and returns correctly functioning code. 

The response is comprehensive, adhering to best practices in Python programming with clean and efficient code structure.
