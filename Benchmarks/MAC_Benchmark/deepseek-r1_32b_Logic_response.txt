To solve the problem of correctly labeling three boxes labeled 'Apples', 'Oranges', and 'Mixed' (each label being wrong), we need to determine the minimum information required. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the constraints**:
   - Each label is incorrect.
   - The box labeled 'Mixed' cannot be mixed; it must contain either all apples or all oranges.

2. **Pick one fruit from the box labeled 'Mixed'**:
   - If you pick an apple, the box must be 'Apples'.
   - If you pick an orange, the box must be 'Oranges'.

3. **Deduce the contents of the other boxes based on the result**:
   - **Case 1: Picking an apple from the box labeled 'Mixed'**:
     - The box labeled 'Mixed' is actually 'Apples'.
     - The box labeled 'Apples' cannot be 'Apples', so it must be either 'Oranges' or 'Mixed'. Since it can't be mixed (as we've identified), it must be 'Oranges'.
     - The box labeled 'Oranges' cannot be 'Oranges', so it must be 'Mixed'.
   - **Case 2: Picking an orange from the box labeled 'Mixed'**:
     - The box labeled 'Mixed' is actually 'Oranges'.
     - The box labeled 'Oranges' cannot be 'Oranges', so it must be either 'Apples' or 'Mixed'. Since it can't be mixed, it must be 'Apples'.
     - The box labeled 'Apples' cannot be 'Apples', so it must be 'Mixed'.

By picking one fruit from the box labeled 'Mixed', we obtain sufficient information to correctly relabel all the boxes.

\[
\boxed{Pick one fruit from the box labeled 'Mixed'}
