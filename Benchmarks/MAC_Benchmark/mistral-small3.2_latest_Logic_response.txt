Alright, let's tackle this puzzle step by step. We have three boxes, each labeled incorrectly:

1. Box labeled 'Apples'
2. Box labeled 'Oranges'
3. Box labeled 'Mixed'

Our goal is to correctly label all the boxes by picking just one fruit from one box. Here's how I think we can approach this:

### Understanding the Problem

First, it's crucial to understand that all the labels are wrong. This means:

- The box labeled 'Apples' does not contain only apples.
- The box labeled 'Oranges' does not contain only oranges.
- The box labeled 'Mixed' does not contain a mix of apples and oranges.

Given that, let's think about what each box could actually contain.

### Possible Contents of Each Box

Since all labels are wrong, here's what each box cannot have:

1. 'Apples' box:
   - Cannot have only apples.
   - So, it must have either only oranges or a mix of apples and oranges.

2. 'Oranges' box:
   - Cannot have only oranges.
   - So, it must have either only apples or a mix of apples and oranges.

3. 'Mixed' box:
   - Cannot have a mix.
   - So, it must have only apples or only oranges.

### Strategy to Determine Correct Labels

To correctly label all boxes with just one pick, we need to find a box where picking a fruit can give us the most information. Here's the strategy:

1. Pick a fruit from the box labeled 'Mixed'. Why? Because we know this box cannot have a mix, so it must have only one type of fruit. Picking from here will tell us exactly what's inside.

   - If we pick an apple from the 'Mixed' box:
     - Then this box actually contains only apples.
   - If we pick an orange from the 'Mixed' box:
     - Then this box actually contains only oranges.

Let's explore both scenarios.

#### Scenario 1: Picking an apple from the 'Mixed' box

- 'Mixed' box actually contains only apples.

Now, we know:

- 'Mixed' box: only apples.

Now, let's look at the other two boxes:

- 'Apples' box: cannot be apples (label is wrong), and it cannot be 'Mixed' because the 'Mixed' box is already only apples. So, it must be only oranges.

- 'Oranges' box: cannot be oranges (label is wrong), and it cannot be only apples because the 'Mixed' box is only apples. So, it must be 'Mixed'.

So, the correct labels would be:

- 'Apples' box: only oranges.
- 'Oranges' box: mixed.
- 'Mixed' box: only apples.

#### Scenario 2: Picking an orange from the 'Mixed' box

- 'Mixed' box actually contains only oranges.

Now, we know:

- 'Mixed' box: only oranges.

Now, let's look at the other two boxes:

- 'Oranges' box: cannot be oranges (label is wrong), and it cannot be 'Mixed' because the 'Mixed' box is only oranges. So, it must be only apples.

- 'Apples' box: cannot be apples (label is wrong), and it cannot be only oranges because the 'Mixed' box is only oranges. So, it must be 'Mixed'.

So, the correct labels would be:

- 'Apples' box: mixed.
- 'Oranges' box: only apples.
- 'Mixed' box: only oranges.

### Verifying the Approach

In both scenarios, by picking a fruit from the 'Mixed' box (which we know cannot be mixed), we can deduce the contents of all boxes correctly. Here's why this works:

- The 'Mixed' box must contain only one type of fruit, so picking from it tells us exactly what's inside.
- Once we know what's in the 'Mixed' box, the other two boxes can only be determined based on the fact that their labels are also wrong and that the remaining possibilities are the only ones left.

### Minimum Information Needed

The minimum information needed is:

- The result of picking one fruit from the box labeled 'Mixed'.

This single piece of information allows us to deduce the contents of all three boxes correctly.

### Step-by-Step Summary

1. **Pick a fruit from the box labeled 'Mixed'.**
   - Since the label is wrong, this box must contain only one type of fruit (either all apples or all oranges).

2. **Determine the actual content of the 'Mixed' box based on the fruit picked.**
   - If you pick an apple: 'Mixed' box is only apples.
   - If you pick an orange: 'Mixed' box is only oranges.

3. **Deduce the contents of the other two boxes based on the first deduction.**
   - For the 'Apples' and 'Oranges' boxes, their labels are wrong, and they cannot be the same as the 'Mixed' box's actual content.

4. **Assign the correct labels accordingly.**
   - The remaining possibilities will uniquely determine what each box actually contains.

### Final Answer

To correctly label all the boxes with the minimum information needed, follow these steps:

1. **Pick one fruit from the box labeled 'Mixed'.**
   - Since the label is incorrect, this box must contain only one type of fruit (either all apples or all oranges).

2. **Analyze the result:**
   - **If you draw an apple:**
     - The 'Mixed' box is actually 'Apples'.
     - The 'Oranges' box cannot be oranges (label is wrong) and cannot be apples (since 'Mixed' is apples), so it must be 'Mixed'.
     - The 'Apples' box must then be 'Oranges'.
   - **If you draw an orange:**
     - The 'Mixed' box is actually 'Oranges'.
     - The 'Apples' box cannot be apples (label is wrong) and cannot be oranges (since 'Mixed' is oranges), so it must be 'Mixed'.
     - The 'Oranges' box must then be 'Apples'.

3. **Relabel the boxes accordingly based on the scenario you observe.**

This method ensures that with just one fruit picked from the 'Mixed' box, you can correctly relabel all three boxes.
