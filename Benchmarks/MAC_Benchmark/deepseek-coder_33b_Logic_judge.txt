Scores: Correctness=3, Efficiency=2, Outcome=1
Reasoning: The model uses an incorrect approach by suggesting the need for multiple examples rather than solving the problem with a single fruit from the 'Mixed' box. The solution should rely on logical deduction, not Bayesian inference or multiple combinations.
